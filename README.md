# 🧬 Bio-Containment Management (SQL)

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries created for a university project focused on managing laboratories, employees, and bio-containment zones. The goal is to practice relational database skills through complex queries and view creation.

## 🗃️ Project Description
The project simulates a database that includes:

- Employees (regular and qualified)  
- Bio-containment zones with different security levels  
- Employee assignments to zones  
- Laboratories and biological agents  

Using various SQL queries, it is possible to generate useful reports such as:

- Zones with dangerous agents  
- Responsible or currently assigned employees  
- Regular employees not exposed to high-level zones  
- Zones with high presence of qualified personnel  

## 💡 Technologies
- Standard SQL  
- RDBMS: MySQL or compatible  

## 🧪 Main Content
- Queries using `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `UNION`  
- View creation with `CREATE VIEW`  
- Subqueries using `IN`, `NOT IN`  

## 📁 Files
- `consultes.sql`: main file containing all queries  

## 📝 Notes
This project is part of a university database course practice. It does not include table definitions, but the queries assume a coherent and normalized data structure.
